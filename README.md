# TCP-Chat-Server-Room
A tcp based server chat room implemented using socket programming in Ubuntu in C. 

Very rudimentary and not threat I just created this to play with socket programming a bit. Not very thread safe. 
Works for up to 5 clients - that can be changed in the code easily. You can simulate a connected client from Ubuntu's terminal or Telnet app...
Might update this in the future.
